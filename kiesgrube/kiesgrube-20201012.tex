\item Maven, JavaFX, jlink, jpackager, jpackage, javapackager, JMOD? Is anyone an expert in Java deployment and can give me advice?
\item ZIP file with portable JRE, JavaFX dependencies and native libraries works for now but is not suitable for a rapid feedback-update cycle.
\item Professional solution with Windows installer and auto updater could be very time consuming.
